# Sphere Break

Sphere Break is a minigame featured in the videogame Final Fantasy X-2. The goal is to use the coins on the board to score enough points to reach a predetermined Quota.

The game ends when the player reaches the Quota set at the beginning of the game. The player loses if the Quota is not reached before the end of the last turn or if the timer reaches 0.
